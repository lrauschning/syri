## Identifying genomic differences using SyRI

SyRI requires assemblies to be at chromosome-level for accurate identification of SRs. If chromosome-level assemblies are not available, one can create pseudo-chromosome level assemblies using [chroder](scaforder.md) utility. 

### Whole-genome alignment
SyRI uses whole-genome alignments as input. These can be generated using whole-genome aligner of user's choice (check [installation guide](install.md). Here, we would use [MUMmer3](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/) package.

Firstly, the genomes (in multi-fasta format) are aligned using the NUCmer utility.
```bash
nucmer --maxmatch -c 500 -b 500 -l 100 refgenome qrygenome;
```

Here, `-c`,`-b`, and `-l` are parameters used to control the alignment resolution and need to be adjusted based on the genome size and complexity. More details are available [here](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/manual/#nucmer).

NUCmer would generate an `out.delta` file as output. The identified alignments are filtered using `delta-filter`  and then converted into a tab-separated [format](fileformat.md) using `show-coords`.

```bash
delta-filter -m -i 90 -l 100 out.delta > out_m_i90_l100.delta; 
show-coords -THrd out_m_i90_l100.delta > out_m_i90_l100.coords;
```

Users can change values for `-i`, and `-l` input to suit their genomes and specifc scientific problem. More information is available [here](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/manual/#filter).

For identificaiton of structural rearrangements (which include duplications), overlapping alignments are not filtered out. In the example above, `--maxmatch` (for nucmer) results in identificaiton of all alignments. The `-m` (for delta-filter) parameter removes redundant alignments, though it is not necessary but is used as it helps in significantly reducing number of alignments which in turn reduces time and memory required by SyRI. Finally, `-THrd` (for show-coords) converts the alignments form `.delta` format to `.tsv` format consisting of alignment coordinates required by SyRI.

For alignments generated using MUMmer3, CIGAR strings are not required. For other aligners, the whole genome alignments can be parsed either in SAM/BAM format or in a `.tsv` with CIGAR string for each alignment for the identification of SNPs and short indels (however, structural rearrangements and structural variations can be identified without CIGAR strings).

### SR identification using `syri`
SyRI takes genome alignments coordinates as input. Additionally, fasta files for the two genomes will also be required if structure variations are also needed. Further, for short variation identification, when CIGAR strings are not available, `.delta` file (as generated from NUCmer) will also be requried.

#### SR identification
In case the chromosome IDs for the two assemblies are not identical, SyRI would try to find homologous chromosomes and then map their IDs to be identical. This behaviour can be turned off using the `--no-chrmatch` parameter.

Other parameters in this section regulate how translocation and duplications (TDs) are identified. For small networks of overlapping candidate TDs, SyRI uses a brute-force method to find the optimal set of TDs. The time allowed to this method can be restricted using the `-b` parameter. If for a network, brute-force method take more than the assigned time, then it will automatically switch to a randomized-greedy method. The `--unic` and `--unip` parameters state how unique a candidate TD need to be. Candidates which overlap highly with syntenic path and inversions and thus do not pass these thresholds will be filtered out. From a network of candidate TDs, it is possible to select different set of candidates. The `--inc` threshold is used decide whether a new set of candidates is better then the current candidate and thus can be selected as the solution or not.

#### Parameters for local variation identificaiton
The `--allow-offset` parameter is used to define a threshold to decide whether two consecutive alignments within an annotated blocks are overlapping or not. Alignments, for which number of overlapping bases are more than `--allow-offset` will result CNVs (copyloss/copygain).
Short variations (SNPs, small indels) are identified by either using CIGAR strings for the alignments or using the `show-snps` utility in MUMmer package (requires `.delta` file). User can set `--cigar` when using CIGAR. If the `show-snps` is not in enironment path, then `-s` can be used to provide path to it. By default, SyRI do not report short variations within duplicated regions because they lack one-to-one mapping between regions, which in turn renders short variations ambiguous. However, user can set `--all` which will return all short variations within all annotated alignments.
